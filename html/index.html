                        <p class="text">Organic waste is a valuable resource that
                            holds the potential for multiple benefits.
                            By decomposing naturally, organic waste can
                           be transformed into nutrient-rich compost, 
                           enhancing soil fertility and promoting 
                             sustainable agriculture. Recycling organic 
                             waste helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
                             and mitigates the burden on landfill sites.
                              Embracing organic waste management practices
                               contributes to a circular economy, conserving
                                resources and fostering a greener, healthier 
                                planet.</p>

                        <p class = "text">Inorganic waste, also known as non-biodegradable waste, poses unique challenges
                            to our environment and requires specialized management 
                            strategies. From plastics to metals and glass, t
                            hese materials take an exceptionally long time to 
                            decompose naturally. To protect our planet, 
                            it is crucial to implement efficient recycling 
                            programs, promote responsible disposal, and explore 
                            innovative ways to minimize the generation of inorganic 
                            waste. By adopting sustainable practices, we can reduce the
